Bayesian Network for Traffic Congestion Prediction
Reproducing & Extending the BN from “Bayesian Network for Analysis and Prediction of Traffic Congestion Using Accident Data”
Using the Cambridgeshire Road Traffic Collision Dataset
📌 Overview

This project reproduces—with corrections and enhancements—the Bayesian Network (BN) described in the paper:

“Bayesian Network for Analysis and Prediction of Traffic Congestion Using Accident Data”

Using the publicly available Cambridgeshire Road Traffic Collision dataset, this repository implements:

✓ A full preprocessing pipeline
✓ Feature engineering identical to the paper’s methodology
✓ Construction of both 2-class and 3-class congestion labels
✓ The exact BN structure described in the paper (with one corrected edge removed)
✓ Training & inference using pgmpy
✓ Final evaluation of prediction accuracy and macro-F1
✓ Network structure visualization (NetworkX)

⚠️ Important: This is not the implementation from the original authors.
This is my independent replication based on the paper's described BN and methodology.
